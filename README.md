# BloxThemes

A very simple chrome extension that allows you to apply a theme to roblox.com.
I made it because I though RoPro had too much i didn't need, and the animated
themes were locked behind a paywall. **This is hobby project!!**

## Current Themes

If you want to request a theme, you can do so by opening an issue.
